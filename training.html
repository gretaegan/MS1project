    <h3>Integrated Training</h3>
    <p>Our integrated course combines all aspect of training needed to go from zero hours to commercial airline ready in a timeframe of 24 months average.
    It consists of 250 hours flying, and 6 months of classroom learning followed by the 14 written ATPL Examinations. Cadets will
    need to pass three flying Skills tests throughout the course (PPL, CPL and ME/IR) and will eventually finish up with an Airline Transport Pilot License (ATPL). Due to the extremely intense and fast pace of the course, certain entry requirements will need to be
       met before we can offer you a place on this course. Find out more on our <a href="#">contact</a> page. Pricing for this course is 89,000€</p>

     <h3>Private Pilots License</h3>
     <p>The PPL is a popular course for people who would like to fly as a hobby, or for people who want to take their training step by step. Flown in a Cessna152, the course
     consists of 45 hours flying and 60 hours groundschool. Cadets will need to pass a Skills test and 4 written exams before being issued with the license. Pricing is 12,000€</p>

    <h3>Commercial Pilots License</h3>
    <p>The CPL is the first step for people who want to become an airline pilot. It consists of 100 hours of solo cross country flying, followed by 25 hours in our C172RG
    aircraft. Cadets will learn how to flight plan at a commercial level and start getting used to the concept of carrying passengers. A Skills test will be flown in order to
    be issued with the license. Cadets MUST hold a PPL in order to begin this course. Pricing is 20,000€</p>
   </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
    <h3>Multi Engine Instrument Rating</h3>
    <p> The ME/IR combines two rating, the multi-engine piston and the Instrument rating. The course consists of 30 hours dual instruction in our Beechcraft76 aircraft, and 
     45 hours in a simulator of the same type. The ME/IR skills test is considered the most challenging aspect of becoming a pilot, so cadets can not be considered for 
     this course unless they hold a CPL. Pricing is 25,000€ </p>

   <h3> The APS MCC </h3>
   <p>The Airline Pilot Standard Multi Crew Cooperation course is a requirment for all cadets who wish to hold an ATPL. The aim of this course is to leave behind the single-pilot mindset and learn
   how to fly in a multi-crew jet cockpit. This course is not pass/fail but a certain standard is expected to be met. It is held in our full-motion Boeing 737-800 simulator. The course 
   consists of 4 days of groundschool followed by 40 hours of simulator time. Airlines such as 
   Ryanair state in their application that pilots who hold an APS MCC cert will be at a distinct advantage during the interview process. Pricing is 8,000€.
